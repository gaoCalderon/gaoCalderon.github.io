		<h3> <font size="6"> About Site </font> </h3>
		<p> <font size="4"> My beginning background studies was originally Drafting and Media Designs.But things changed and I still have a passion for drawing up floor plans and trying to figure out the geometric layout plans of all things. The simplest hobbie I can make out of my passion is desiging simple doll houses to replicate ideas I may have that also have a performing purpose, usage other than display. I personally haven't started designing or creating anything just yet, but it's been waivering in my mind for some time now. If I were to, this site is a mock up of things I'd like to put effort into. Thank you for taking the time to check out my doll house website. </font> </p>
